      fullText: `It is midnight,

a fellow passenger

wakes me rudely.

I am already in Srinagar.

My suitcase is blue;

it looks purple.

Cars, tongas, people

who came to take

relatives home have left.

The courtyard

of the Tourist Reception

Center is bordered

by red, red rose bushes.

Wild flowers grow

along dank walls.

Screaming

fury of a night train

bearing a sweet name

brought me from

Delhi to Jammu.

A dingy, low roofed

J&K bus, a morgue

on wheels

dumped me here.

This is my home.

No one can stay

forever

in the valley

of mid-summer pleasure;

only I can.

A hindu woman

in pale blue silk,

found dead underneath

a Chinar tree,

four kilometers from

the Tourist Reception Center.

Strawberries

sown into silk

blink

at police lights,

clinging to hope.

A thin moon

wrings her hands,

leaning over

a weeping willow.

An earth gray

body bag

is flown quickly

to my pale faced

husband.

He alone can

do the last rites,

light a sacred

fire for me.

My soul

Ah! My soul

has freed itself.

Apples

almond blossoms

are

my bare shoulders.

Ripe cherries

and peach blossoms.

An inky river

is my hair,

my eyes a soft

black night.

My face parts

from the moon,

in blinding light

I fall, and rise.`,

      description: 'A contemplative exploration of memory, loss, and the dream of returning to a father\'s homeland, juxtaposed with the harsh reality of refugee camps.',
      fullText: `I shall never see his face.

Only hear a voice like

fine music, chanting of mantras

in ancient forest retreats.

My father's old country,

lost to me forever, and ever,

amid the mid west bounty

of summer, becomes my dream.

I hear a footstep near

the red rosebush; the shadows

it casts on moonlit nights

are a bride's downcast eyes.

The pale white robed

Pundarika, the ascetic hero

of an old, old story is

so chaste, pure like a waterfall

that roars sonorous amid

wooded hills, majestic boulders

of Himalaya. Magical pathways

bring me to it: unawares.

Sheltered by leaves

of an ashoka tree, my dream

wakes and sleeps

with the sun and the moon.

Falls on its face

like a toddler of legend,

wearing gold anklets.

Lotus petals are his

shapely lips, morning breezes

stir them slightly, holding

back a wave, a storm, a torrent.

What might be said

gets tangled

in half finished thoughts.

My deep sleep enchants

light step of the bluejay,

red throated squeak

of a cardinal in midsummer.

Egrets step on white sand,

five fathoms of the Atlantic.

Do they still turn bones

into coral, eyes into pearls?

II

Does my father's country

have a dream, a plan,

a safety net, a strategy

to retrieve the banished native.

He lives in a refugee camp in Udhampur,

becomes a mid summer guest

where he should be a host.

After three days, he boards

a dark blue van; it will take him

back to the camp.

His face is blackened

by a sorrow that has no name.

No legitimacy; it is so like him.

Can someone tell this man:

"stay, don't go." Pull out your keys

open jammed locks of your house

in Vanpooh, the river town in the south.

See if the squirrel

your twelve year old used to feed

has her nest where it used to be.

If the burnt down temple near your

house can be mended enough

to let a deity return in gentle peace?

My dream is maya, and this man's

refugee camp, his no-home,

his comings and goings are to`,

      description: 'A haunting meditation on the violence and loss in Kashmir, told through the figure of Aftab Ram, a village medicine man, and the stories of those who have disappeared or been killed.',
      fullText: `It's bitter cold.

And I'm sick at heart.

Who is there?

Soldiers stand guard.

One relieves the other,

stepping on thin ice.

Army boots always

scared him. He wore

soft soled shoes

Whenever he went

to Srinagar

to visit his eldest son.

Wooden sandals

with cloth straps

adorned his beautiful

feet at home.

He is barefoot now,

treads softly on ice.

It is like glass

strewn on Mahatma

Gandhi's path

when he led the Salt March.

He is an apparition,

my grandfather.

He is asking a question.

National Rifles men

at Anantnag's Lal Chowk

do not know who he is.

He is Aftab Ram

of Kulgam, a village

medicine man whom

everyone used to know.

Their show of violence

scares him away.

He lurks in corners.

It is you, my father,

he wishes to speak

to you. Visit his

village, his house;

lend ear to his story.

Believe it.

He is no ghost,

not thin as air.

His white robe

is real.

Not a shadow warrior

in a Samurai film,

he has been violated.

A newspaper bearing

his name, Aftab, or

Srinagar Sun

reports horrors he can

not come to terms with.

A Muslim woman named

Khadija appeals

to the Party of God

asking for her

disappeared husband.

She says: "I am your

sister. What have

you done to my husband?

My two years old son

misses his father

His name is Abdul Hamid

Daar. He is twenty five,

five foot seven, dark

curly hair, fair complexioned.

What have you done to him?"

A Hindu man's father

has died, has been killed.

Drowned in Jhelum

waters when he was

praying to the morning sun

on Makar Sankranti.

This man, Pandit Shiv Nath,

appeals to the Party

of God's area commanders:

permit me to cremate

my father. Please do not

force me to bury him.

That won't do.

I am Hindu. Won't you

issue me a travel permit

so I can go to Haridwar, to

immerse my father's

ashes in the Ganges.

My grandfather reads,

listens, shrugs

his shoulders, walks on.

He finds out Khadija's

husband did not return.

Her son became a mute.

Sweet syllables

of Kashmiri prattle

crashed against

a blind wall as he

fled in terror.

She had been hanged,

hands tied behind

her back. He was

brought in to see.

In Pandit Shiv Nath's

courtyard snow roses

and stars shielded

a frail, work-worn body

all winter. Spring

winds rotted it away.

Aftab Ram's shadow

grows taller, thinner.

It falls on blood

splattered walls,

as he reads, listens.

He is a shrewd

unsentimental man.

He does not weep.

He is Kashmir Today

He will wait, wait

for my father, my uncle.

He will wait for me

across the river.`,

      title: 'Fragmented Memory',
      artist: 'Veer Munshi',
      description: 'A complex monochromatic collage of fragmented pieces featuring traditional Kashmiri motifs, representing shattered homeland and dispersed cultural identity.',
      fullDescription: `This intricate artwork by Veer Munshi is a densely packed collage or assemblage composed of hundreds of irregularly shaped, interlocking fragments. The piece features a rich visual tapestry of patterns and textures in shades of black, white, and grey, creating a stark and somber tone that reflects themes of fragmentation and loss.

The artwork incorporates numerous traditional South Asian and Kashmiri decorative motifs, including mandalas, rosettes, paisley patterns, and intricate scrollwork. Towards the center, a more coherent image emerges depicting a clustered settlement or small town, possibly with traditional architecture, situated along a body of water or valley floor, with mountains suggesting a specific geographical location.

The fragmented nature of the piece is a key visual and thematic element, suggesting brokenness, dispersion, or the piecing together of disparate elements. The artwork powerfully represents a shattered homeland, dispersed cultural identity, and the intricate web of personal and collective memory in the context of exile and displacement.`,
